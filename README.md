# Exploratory-data-analysis-
Terrorism data analysis and visualizing

Dataset - https://bit.ly/2TK5Xn5



### Why I chose this project?
In 2021, Taliban overthrew the government and took Afghanistan into control. This motivated me to explore more about the world terrorism. 


I did an exploratory analysis on the data, gained the possible facts and insights I could using python's various libraries.
Libraries used:
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Follium

Made a simple ppt to document my insights
